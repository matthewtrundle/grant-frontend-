## Top 5 Worst Offenders (Fix These First)

### 1. HOMEPAGE - Fake Stats Everywhere
**Current:** "40% Success Rate | $50K Average Grant | 14 Days to Submit"
**Issue:** Zero proof. Sounds made up.
**Fix:** "BioNova won $2.4M after 3 rejections (see their story) | 23 medtech companies joined this week"

### 2. ONBOARDING - Generic Robot Enthusiasm  
**Current:** "You're all set! We've analyzed your innovation and we're excited 🎉"
**Issue:** Says nothing specific. Emoji feels forced.
**Fix:** "Found 12 grants worth $8.4M for [YOUR COMPANY]'s [SPECIFIC TECH]. Here are your top 3..."

### 3. PRICING - Boring Feature Lists
**Current:** "✓ Stage 3: Comprehensive RFP Analysis"
**Issue:** What does this DO for me?
**Fix:** "✓ We read the 47-page RFP so you don't have to cry"

### 4. DASHBOARD - Corporate Journey BS
**Current:** "Continue your grant application journey"
**Issue:** No human talks like this.
**Fix:** "You're 23% to $2M funding. Next: Find 5 grants (8 min)"

### 5. TESTIMONIALS - Obviously Fake
**Current:** "Sarah Thompson, CEO, Quantum Diagnostics" + no photo
**Issue:** Name/company sound AI-generated. Zero proof.
**Fix:** Video testimonial from REAL customer with LinkedIn badge OR delete it
