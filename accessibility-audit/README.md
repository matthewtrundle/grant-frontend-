## Key Design System Observations

### Strengths
✅ **Black & white theme**: Excellent contrast potential (21:1 ratio)
✅ **Purple accent (#9333ea)**: Good contrast on both backgrounds
✅ **Typography scale**: Clear hierarchy with heading/body classes
✅ **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations, just need reduced motion
✅ **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of header, nav, main, section, footer

### Weaknesses
❌ **Body text too light**: #404040 and #d4d4d4 fail WCAG AA
❌ **Subtle borders**: #e5e5e5 and #262626 too faint (1.12:1)
❌ **Focus ring dark**: Not visible on black backgrounds
❌ **Gradient yellow**: #eab308 fails contrast (1.95:1)
❌ **No motion preferences**: Animations always play

## Legal & Compliance Context

### Why This Matters

**Legal Requirements**:
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**: Websites are "places of public accommodation"
- **Section 508**: Required for federal contracts
- **AODA** (Ontario): Required for businesses with 50+ employees
- **European Accessibility Act**: Effective June 2025

**Lawsuit Risk**: Web accessibility lawsuits increased 14% in 2023 (UsableNet). Average settlement: $25,000-$75,000.

**Business Impact**:
- **15% of global population** has some form of disability
- **71% of disabled users** leave websites with barriers (Click-Away Pound Survey)
- **Google ranking**: Accessibility is a confirmed ranking factor

**Bottom Line**: Fixing these issues is not optional. It's legal compliance, risk mitigation, and good business.

---

## ROI Analysis

### Cost of NOT Fixing
- **Legal risk**: $25K-$75K average lawsuit settlement
- **Lost customers**: 15% of potential users excluded
- **SEO penalty**: Lower Google rankings
- **Brand damage**: Perceived as discriminatory/careless
- **Time waste**: Harder to fix later when tech debt accumulates

### Cost of Fixing
- **Phase 1 (Critical)**: 8 hours @ $100/hr = $800
- **Phase 2 (High Priority)**: 16 hours @ $100/hr = $1,600
- **Phase 3 (Nice-to-have)**: 10 hours @ $100/hr = $1,000
- **Total**: $3,400 for full AAA compliance

**ROI**: Invest $800 to eliminate $25K+ legal risk = **31x return**
