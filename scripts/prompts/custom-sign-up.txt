Create a custom Sign-Up component for a Next.js 14 App Router application using Clerk authentication with email verification.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use the `useSignUp()` hook from `@clerk/nextjs` for headless authentication
2. Must be a client component ("use client")
3. Implement multi-step sign-up flow:
   - Step 1: Email + Password entry
   - Step 2: Email verification code entry
4. Match the existing glassmorphic dark theme aesthetic
5. Redirect to /onboarding after successful sign-up

DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Background: Dark (#0A0A0F) with circuit pattern and gradient mesh
- Form card: backdrop-blur-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/10 shadow-2xl
- Inputs: bg-white/5 border-white/10 text-white with purple focus ring
- Primary button: Gradient from purple-600 to blue-600 with glow effect
- Text: White with various opacity levels for hierarchy
- Step indicator: Show "Step 1 of 2" or "Step 2 of 2"

FUNCTIONALITY:

STEP 1 - EMAIL & PASSWORD:
1. Email input field with validation
2. Password input field with:
   - Show/hide toggle
   - Strength indicator
   - Minimum 8 characters requirement
3. Confirm password field
4. Submit button with loading state
5. Error message display
6. "Already have an account?" link to /sign-in
7. Validation:
   - Email format check
   - Password match confirmation
   - Password strength requirements

STEP 2 - EMAIL VERIFICATION:
1. Display verification message with email address
2. 6-digit code input field (could use multiple inputs or single input)
3. Verify button with loading state
4. Resend code link
5. Error display for invalid codes
6. "Back" link to return to step 1

CLERK API FLOW:
```typescript
const { signUp, setActive } = useSignUp();

// Step 1: Create sign-up attempt
await signUp.create({
  emailAddress: email,
  password: password,
});

// Send verification code
await signUp.prepareEmailAddressVerification({
  strategy: "email_code"
});

// Move to step 2
setCurrentStep(2);

// Step 2: Verify code
await signUp.attemptEmailAddressVerification({
  code: verificationCode,
});

// Set active session and redirect
await setActive({ session: signUp.createdSessionId });
router.push("/onboarding");
```

COMPONENT STRUCTURE:
- Wrapper div with background layers
- Centered glassmorphic card
- Conditional rendering based on current step (step 1 or 2)
- Form state management for:
  - email
  - password
  - confirmPassword
  - verificationCode
  - currentStep (1 or 2)
  - isLoading
  - error
- Progress indicator showing current step

ERROR HANDLING:
- Email already exists
- Weak password
- Password mismatch
- Invalid verification code
- Code expired (allow resend)
- Network errors
- Rate limiting

SPECIAL FEATURES:
1. Password strength meter (visual indicator)
2. Real-time password match validation
3. Verification code input with auto-focus
4. Countdown timer for code resend (60 seconds)
5. Smooth transitions between steps

STYLING:
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Match circuit background from existing auth pages
- Animated transitions for step changes
- Glow effects on primary button
- Focus states for all inputs
- Loading spinner on buttons

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Export as default a React functional component named `CustomSignUpForm`
- Include all necessary imports
- Add TypeScript types for form state and steps
- Include JSDoc comments
- Use AnimatePresence from framer-motion for step transitions

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Proper form labels
- ARIA live regions for error messages
- ARIA attributes for step indicator
- Keyboard navigation between fields
- Visible focus indicators

VALIDATION HELPERS:
Include helper functions for:
- Email format validation
- Password strength checking
- Password match verification
