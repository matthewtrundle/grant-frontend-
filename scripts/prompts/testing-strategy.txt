Create a comprehensive testing strategy for custom Clerk authentication components in a Next.js 14 application.

CONTEXT:
We've replaced Clerk's prebuilt <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components with custom implementations using Clerk's headless hooks (useSignIn() and useSignUp()).

COMPONENTS TO TEST:

1. **CustomSignInForm** - Located at app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
   - Email + password authentication
   - Uses useSignIn() hook
   - Redirects to /dashboard on success

2. **CustomSignUpForm** - Located at app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx
   - Multi-step flow: Email/Password → Email Verification
   - Uses useSignUp() hook
   - Password strength meter
   - 6-digit verification code
   - Redirects to /onboarding on success

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:

Generate a comprehensive testing strategy that includes:

1. **Manual Testing Checklist**
   - Step-by-step instructions for testing each component
   - Expected outcomes at each step
   - Edge cases to verify
   - Error scenarios to test

2. **Automated Testing Strategy**
   - Recommend testing tools (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright, etc.)
   - Unit test cases for key functions
   - Integration test scenarios
   - E2E test flows

3. **Test Data Setup**
   - Sample test user credentials
   - Mock Clerk responses for testing
   - Test verification codes

4. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Key screenshots to capture
   - Components to verify visually
   - Responsive breakpoints to test

5. **Security Testing**
   - Authentication flow security checks
   - Input validation testing
   - XSS/injection prevention verification

6. **Performance Testing**
   - Load time benchmarks
   - Metrics to track
   - Performance optimization checks

7. **Accessibility Testing**
   - WCAG compliance checklist
   - Screen reader testing steps
   - Keyboard navigation verification

8. **Integration Points to Verify**
   - Clerk API integration
   - Navigation/routing
   - Onboarding flow handoff
   - Metadata storage in Clerk

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create a detailed Markdown document with:
- Clear section headers
- Numbered step-by-step instructions
- Code examples for automated tests
- Checklists with checkboxes [ ]
- Expected vs actual result templates
- Success criteria for each test category

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Clerk authentication
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- React Hook Form (if applicable)

Generate a production-ready testing strategy that ensures the custom auth components work flawlessly.
